#Team-Collaborate
This is an online based sharing application that allows lab partners, professors, and other students
to share code and other projects seamlessly. Users can share file access to different directories, and
allow access to only modify certain files. 

This project fosters communication and innovation through simplyifying the collaboration process.
Currently this project <br><strong>is in progress</strong>, however a working version is published below. -Pablo Fernandez
